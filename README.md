# PDF-Chat

## Chat with PDF using RAG and Google Generative AI

### ðŸ“œ Project Description

This project allows users to interact with uploaded PDF files using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Google Generative AI**. The application extracts text from PDFs, splits the text into chunks, stores embeddings in a FAISS vector store, and provides answers to user queries by retrieving relevant context from the documents.

Key features:
- Upload multiple PDF files and process them.
- Ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- Get detailed answers with relevant context from the PDFs.
- Powered by Google Generative AI and FAISS for embeddings and vector storage.
